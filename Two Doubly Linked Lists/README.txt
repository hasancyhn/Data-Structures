Create two doubly linked lists by taking the number of elements from the user.
Create the lists in the following order, not sorted: 1st list 1st element (address 5) -> 2nd list 1st element (address 6) -> 1st list 2nd element (address 7) -> 2nd list 2nd element (address 8) (the addresses within the lists should not be sorted).

Print the addresses of the lists.

Merge the lists into a single list by rearranging the addresses without modifying the data within the lists.

Print the addresses again (to indicate that there are no address changes when merging the lists).

Reverse the merged list.

Print the list starting from the beginning. The largest address should be at the beginning.
